# Musa Live Coding Environment for Bitwig Studio

**Bitwig Studio Controller for Musa Live Coding Environment.**

This project is part of **Musa Live Coding Environment**.

Musa Live Coding Environment is a suite of components to add a live coding environment based on [Musa-DSL](https://github.com/javier-sy/musa-dsl) to several DAW's (Ableton Live 11 or higher and Bitwig Studio 5 or higher, for the moment).

The suite is composed of:
- Atom source code editor (where the user edits the source code of the composition and can submit commands to run on real-time).
- musa-dsl-atom-repl plugin for Atom editor (that allows Atom editor to communicate with the server).
- MusaLCEServer processing server (the server that interprets the source code and the commands submitted by the user).
- MusaLCEforLive Ableton Live Controller (that establishes the communication between Ableton Live and the server).
- MusaLCEforBitwig Bitwig Studio Controller (that establishes the communication between Bitwig Studio and the server).

You need also, of course, Ableton Live 11 or greater or Bitwig Studio 5 or greater.

MusaLCEforBitwig (this component) integrates with Bitwig Studio as a MIDI Controller Script.
